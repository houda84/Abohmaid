## Wire Bending project:

### Problems:

- default software has bugs and not intergated in any common design software(Rhino3d: https://www.rhino3d.com/).
- machine calibration is not accurate.
- not modular "one application for design, computation and machine control".
- Java :) ; dose not have enough computational libraries.
- calibration data is stored localy, user dosn't have access to calibration data from other users.
